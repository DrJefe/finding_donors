    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Naive Bayes classifiers have been used email spam filters and can be found in a variety of online products such as Spamihilator (https://www.spamihilator.com/en/) and SpamBayes (http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/).  Naive Bayes classifiers work quickly with large amounts of training data.  The classifier also looks at each feature independently which alleviates the effect of the curse of dimensionality.  Naive Bayes classifiers perform poorly when the features are dependent on each other and affect the classification.  I believe a GaussianNB classifier will work well with this data given there is a large amount of features (103) and many of these features should be independent from each other (ex. race, sex, relationship, occupation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are commonly used in data mining and analytics tools such as IBM's SPSS Statistics (https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/spss-decision-trees).  By correctly categorizing people into different segments and looking at the probability at which a segment will purchase a product, the company can more appropriately target segments for marketing.  The strengths of decision trees is they are relatively easy to visualize and understand.  Decision trees also do not require normalization of the data and they can use data that has both numerical and categorical values.  Decision trees perform poorly by often overfitting requiring the programmer to adjust the maximum depth and minimum number of samples in each tree node.  Decision trees can also be biased if one class dominates the data.  While normalizing and preprocessing the data has already been done, I believe a Decision Tree will perform well with the large amount of data it has to analyze.  The Decision Tree will not have a problem with the percent of individuals in each class being highly skewed.  Also, with donor information provided by CharityML, this model could scale up to find  population segments that are more likely to be donors rather than just looking at segments who are likely to have a certain income level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines have been used in biology to help classify the unknown genes into functional categories (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall04/cos557/Articles/knowledge-based_anal_microarr_using_SVM_pnas.pdf).  SVMs are useful in that they can handle data with a large amount of features.  They also have access to a variety of kernels which provides SVMs with more versatility.  SVMs perform poorly when the number of features greatly outnumber the number of samples.  Considering there are 45222 samples and 103 features, I believe a SVM will have enough samples to acurately fit the features.  Also having a high feature space would tend to support the use of a SVM.      "

    "**Answer: **  From our results, I would recommend using a Decision Tree Classifier to identify individuals making more than \\$50,000.  Since both the Decision Tree and the Support Vector Machine have a significantly higher accuracy and F-scores than the GaussianNB model, with the SVM being slightly more accurate and precise, I would not recommend the Gaussian Naive Bayes model.  Furthermore, when we look at the training time, we can see the SVM takes much longer to process the data.  If CharityML needed to scale up the amount of potential donors to include major metropolitan areas with populations in the hundreds of thousands to millions of people, the SVM training time would drastically increase.  Considering CharityML may want to run this model multiple times as more information comes in about donor demographics, the best model for them to use is a Decision Tree Classifier."

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*"

    "**Answer: ** Basically, our Decision Tree Classifier is going to work by creating categories of people based on their features.  The model will thn give each category a label of either over \\$50,000 or less than or equal to \\$50,000 based on the majority of labels of its members.  Having labeled all of the categories, the model can now assign a label to any new person.  When choosing how break down each feature into separate categories, our model is going to use idea of information gain.  This means that at every branch of our decision tree, we are creating more uniform groups.  \n",
    "For example, our initial population has 33% of individuals making over \\$50,000 a year.  If we were to pick a person at random, we would have a 33% of picking a person making over \\$50,000 and a 67% chance of picking someone making less than or equal to \\$50,000.  If our model created different categories based on education level, we would then have increased our probability of picking someone making over \\$50,000 from 33% or increased our probability of picking someone makin less than or equal to \\$50,000 from 67%.  By creating more uniform groups, our model allows us to predict a person's income with more certainty."

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

Education level would be next as industries such as teaching or business, a person with a doctorate or masters degree would be expected to make more than a person with a bachelors or high school degree.  Age would also be an important factor as generally older people would be expected to have a higher income having worked a company for a long time and receiving promotions and salary raises.  This would have a cutoff point around 65 where many people would be retiring and seeing a decrease in income.  Already having looked at people in high paying positions who could possibly work less, in general those working 40+ hours per week would have higher incomes than those working part-time.  Finally, I believe native country may affect the predictor as people from certain countries may be immigrating either as technical specialists or possibly as refugees, both of which may affect income levels.

    "**Answer:** It is interesting to see both marital status and age in the top five most important features.  I would assume that marriage would be correlated with higher age.  This would confirm my though that higher age leads to higher income up to a certain age.  Also, it may be more likely for married couples to have children.  This added expense may require one or obth of the partners to have a high income to support their family.  Also, as I predicted, education level should be a good predictor of one's income given the higher incomes of doctors, lawyers, and professors.  One aspect I did not consider, a person with high capital gains should have a high income.  Furthermore, a person who has capital losses probably has a high enough income to be making investments, even if those investments were sold for a loss this year. "

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**  The accuracy and F-score using reduced data is practicaly the same as using all the features.  This makes sense given that almost all of the variables' Gini importance comes from these five features.  If training time was a factor I would definitely use the reduced data as my training set.  Even if training time was not a factor, I still would consider using the reduced data as my training set.  Given a decision tree's tendency to overfit, it may be useful to reduce the number of features used in training to improve accuracy and F-score. "
